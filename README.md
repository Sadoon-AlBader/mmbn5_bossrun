This is an xdelta patch for MMBN5 DS which will do the following:

Replace all viruses in ACDC1 with both teams' navis Omega
Replace all viruses in ACDC3 with Darkloids Omega + Bass XX + Darkmega Omega and few extras
Replace all viruses in Oran1 with team navis DS (except Knight and Toad)
Replace all viruses in Oran3 with random assortments of navis (Shademan with chips, 3 darkmegas at once etc) + Knightman & Toadman DS

A few extra features for all boss battles:
Boss music
Max HP at start and heals fully at end
Dark chips will not affect karma or HP
Losing will just quit the battle instead of gameover sequence (like battle images)
You can use enemyloc to repeat battles
